      ><br /><br />
      Robostore commits to delivering all merchandise within a timely manner.
      Packages delivered in the US should expect shipping within 1-3 business
      days. Our primary delivery courier is Fedex. You may check the status of

    <div>
      <strong>Where can I find product specifications?</strong><br /><br />
      Robostore is a verified seller of robotics equipment, and merchandise. We
      understand specifications need to be listed to suit the needs of
      customers. Before ordering any product please read the specifications
      listed in the section below the product page to ensure parts fit your
      needs. We do not provide refunds for wrong sized or incompatible
      equipment. Under certain circumstances we may offer a substitution of
      parts if the required part is of equal or lower price, otherwise you will
      <strong> need </strong> to pay the equivalent prices for an upgrade or
      different model.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      <strong>I can't find the part I am looking for.</strong><br /><br />
      Robostore provides a field to filter the product page and the homepage to
      help you find any product provided by Vendors held on the Robostore Site.
      We also include a search bar at the top center of our Site to search the
      name of any product listed in our store. If a product you are looking for
      is not found in any of these fields, we may not carry your specific item
      yet, and requests can be submitted through our "About" page.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      <strong>Canceling an order.</strong><br /><br />You can cancel Product
      orders that haven't yet entered the shipping process by logging into your
      account, contacting Robostore as soon as possible through the Robostore
      support email. We will verify the status of your order and validate if it
      is cancellable and subject to any fees. Vendors put a lot of effort into
      delivering purchased Products rapidly. If an order has already shipped
      when you contact Robostore, the Product may then be returned subject to
      the terms in the Returns section. Products identified as Special Products
      may not be canceled if a purchase has already been processed specifically
      for you with the manufacturer. Restocking fees up to 20% may apply for
      large quantity order cancellations. Shipping charges are non-refundable.
      Robostore reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order in cases where
      an account has an outstanding balance.

    <h1><strong> Robostore Use and Conditions</strong></h1>
    <div>
      <strong
        >Robostore Inc. (“Robostore” or “we”) operates the www.robostore.com
        website (the “Site”), where buyers (“Customers”) can purchase robotics
        products (“Products”) sold by Robostore and third-party vendors
        (Robostore and such vendors being collectively referred to as “Vendors”
        and individually as a “Vendor”, unless a reference is made to a Vendor
        being a third-party vendor). Robostore provides the Site and resells the
        Products subject to the following terms and conditions. These Conditions
        of Use and Sale (the “Conditions”) form a legally binding contract
        between you (also sometimes referred to as “Customer”) and Robostore in
        relation to your use of the Site and the purchase of Products
        (third-party Vendors are third-party beneficiaries of the “Purchase
        Agreement” and General Provisions sections of these Conditions).
        Robostore reserves the right to modify at any time and without
        notification its Site and the Conditions. Therefore, please check these
        Conditions carefully each time you place an order with, or accept
        delivery of any Products from Robostore. If you are not in agreement
        with one or many of these Conditions, please do not use the Site in any
        way and do not purchase Products. All Products sold on the Site are
        believed to be of good quality and reliable. However, Robostore warns
        against the use of Products in an application where an error or
        malfunctioning could result in damage to property, injury or even death
        of humans or animals. The primary responsibility for the use or
        operation of robots and robotics technology falls on the user. Be
        vigilant and act prudently.</strong

    <br />

    <h1>Purchase Agreement</h1>
    <br />
    <div>
      By accepting delivery of any Product purchased on the Site from a Vendor,
      Customer agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions listed below. You
      and Robostore agree that the following terms and conditions are the
      exclusive terms governing the sales transaction between Customer and a
      Vendor selling Products on the Site. Any attempt to alter, supplement,
      modify or amend these terms and conditions by Customer will be null and
      void. All purchase-sale transactions on the Site by Customer occur between
      a Vendor (i.e. Robostore or a third-party Vendor) and the Customer. In the
      event Customer purchases Products from a third-party Vendor, such
      third-party Vendor will be the “seller of record”. In such a case
      Robostore will only act as a platform provider and payment facilitator and
      will not be a party to the purchase and sale transaction occurring between
      the third-party Vendor and the Customer.
